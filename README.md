# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

In this module, we mainly learned how to use R language doing statistical analysis and visuslization by ggplot2.

# Project Overview

The project is to help manager to review and analyze the newest prototype data and help the manufacturing team to imporve their products.

we are going to use the following methods to do the analysis:

1. Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes

2. Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots

3. Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population

4. Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers

# Resources

- MechaCar MPG dataset

- Suspension Coil dataset

- R and Rstudio

# Results

## 1. Linear Regression to Predict MPG

By appling the multiple linear regression function, we get the following coefficients

We know in linear regression, the size of the coefficient for each independent variable gives you the size of the effect that variable is having on your dependent variable, and the sign on the coefficient (positive or negative) gives you the direction of the effect.

Therefore, from the results above, we can see vehicle length and ground clearance have more positive effect on the MPG variable.

Then we applied the summary function to the linear regression model, the summary is following:

## 2. Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

### Total Summary

### Lots Summary

## 3. T-Tests on Suspension Coils


# Summary

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

- What metric or metrics are you going to test?
- What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?
- What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?
- What data is needed to run the statistical test?
